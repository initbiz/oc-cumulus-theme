# Cumulus theme

## Introduction
The theme is a skeleton for
multilanguage SaaS application
with login and register screen



Main purpose of the theme is to create empty SaaS application using Cumulus plugin.

Using the theme you can install bare Cumulus application with a single click of a mouse. But remember that this is only a suggestion, scheme. Cumulus does not require such a configuration. It is fully up to you how you decide to use it.

Any questions, suggestions and PRs very appreciated :)

## Documentation
This theme is just an example skeleton for your application. You do not have to use it to build applications using CumulusCore, but this may be good place to start and boost the creation of SaaS app.

It is not a requirement, it is just a suggestion. The same applies to [Cumulus Demo]() plugin which is not necessary in your applications. The plugin is a requirement for this theme because the theme is just a demo.

### TL;DR
If you want just see what `Cumulus` can do for you seed some example data to your application using `php artisan cumulus:seed` command.

See [Cumulus Demo]() plugin documentation for more info about the command.

### Play with your own configuration
If you do not want to seed example data using [Cumulus Demo]() plugin than you may want to play with your own configuration.

Remember that if you want to configure the theme by yourself you may get some exceptions or restrictions for your clusters.

Read Cumulus Core documentation to do it a good way.
